  ## Buying Guide on How To Choose The Best Coaxial Cable for Internet


  Before you ever buy a coaxial cable for TV, internet, or even for the modem, you need to consider the following things; be will be able to get a high-quality cable for installation. 


  ### Type of Cable 


  The very first thing that you need to look for is which type of cable you are buying for your requirements at home. Basically, there are two types of cables: those cables that have an impedance of 50 Ω are used for wireless and data communication, while the other ones with the impedance of 75 Ω which are used for video applications. So, first, figure out for what purposes you need the cable, then buy accordingly. 


   When you want a 75 Ω cable like RG59/U and RG6/U, you can get them in 100-, 500-, and 1000- feet lengths. While on the other hand, if you want a typical RG-style cable that comes with an impedance of 50 Ω for data communications, like RG188/U, RG174/U, and RG316/U, you can get them in 100-, 500- and 1000- feet reels. 


  These standard RG-style cables are really good at their performance; these are flexible cables that are perfect fir for tight applications. RG188/U comes with a Teflon-taped outer jacket that is efficient in helping the cable to achieve up to 200-degree C operating temperature. Whereas RG316/U comes with an outer FEP jacket that also helps the cable to bear the 200-degrees C operating temperature to deliver the best performance for you. 


  If you want a wireless connection, you can choose to go for 50 Ω cables with are also found in the low-loss categories: 40-, 200-, and 100-series. These cables are known to be providing far better shielding than the other RG-style cables and are extremely good for RF applications. 


  ### Operating Frequency 


  Another important thing that you shouldn’t ignore looking in a cable is its operating frequency of the signal it carries. When the frequency is greater, the signals generally move away from the conductor of the cable that is mainly present in its center. They move outside of the conductor towards the shield of able. This phenomenon is most commonly known as the “skin effect.”


  This skin effect has a direct relation with the range of signals; how far can they travel over a certain length of cable for a provided power level and frequency. The higher the frequency of the signal, the shorter the distance is covered. 


  So, keeping these things in mind, you should buy a cable that is effective in taking the signals powerfully from one end to another to provide you with the best ever viewing experience. 


  ### Cable Attenuation 


  It is referred to as the amount of signal loss over a certain specific distance. Generally, the higher the frequency, the larger will be the attenuation and vice-versa. Even when the diameter of the cable is larger, the attenuation of the cable will be lower. 


  For example, an RG11/U cable with a 20 AWG centre conductor is known for carrying the signals about twice lesser the distance that RG59/U with 14 AWG centre conductor can carry it. So, it’s very important to figure out how much cable attenuation is needed for the purpose you are buying the cable for. 


  ### Characteristic Impedance 


  This is an important thing in a coax cable that really affects its performance in carrying the signals over a certain distance. Impedance is known as a relationship between a cable’s inductance per unit length to its capacitance per unit length. 


  If you want an optimum signal transfer from your [cable](https://trustedperks.com/best-display-port-cable-for-gaming/), you should consider buying a cable whose characteristic impedance is matched to the resistance/impedance of the load. 


  So, when you consider these things in mind while buying a cable for yourself, you are most likely to get the optimal performance, and you will definitely enjoy your viewing time and even the smoother data transmission feature at home. 


  ### Some Final Words 


  With this guide buying the best coaxial cables for internet, TV, and modem has made very easy. You can easily choose out the one that seems best to you, as we have added in our list all the top-rated and best-selling in our list that will never disappoint you in their performance.

faq:
  - ques: What is a Coaxial Cable?
    ans: "It is a type of cable that has an outer conductive shielding surrounding
      an insulating layer that in turns covers the inner conductor. Coax cables
      are generally used for connecting receivers and radio transmitters to
      their antennas, digital audio, computer network connections, and also for
      the distribution of the cable television signals. "
  - ques: How to know if a Coax cable is good for the internet?
    ans: "Your internet connection should be fast enough to let you enjoy whatever
      you do at it, so a cable for the internet is only best when it is able to
      provide you with faster speed and greater bandwidth. "
  - ques: Does the length of cable affect signal transmission?
    ans: "It is seen that the length of the cable has a significant effect on the
      signal transmission: generally, a 50-feet cable has a noticeable signal
      loss, while a 100-feet cable shows a signal loss of almost 1/3 of the
      original signal at one end. So, this means the shorter the length lesser
      will be the signal loss."
