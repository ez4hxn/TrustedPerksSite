  You might have seen people installing Ethernet cables at home to eliminate the
  internet lagging issues they experienced due to their wireless internet
  router. The reason behind their doing this is that Ethernet cables are more
  effective in providing a strong internet connection than any device with
  wireless connectivity. There are a host of factors that contribute to internet
  lagging by the wireless devices; distance from the network, any hindrance like
  a brick wall, or anything else. 


  However, these Ethernet cables are free from any such issues. They are made of high-quality material that guarantees you a super-strong internet connection under every circumstance. They can be used with any piece of hardware and are extremely efficient in reducing latency and interference, thus increasing the speed of the internet connection.


  There are many types of Ethernet cables; however, if you are indecisive about selecting between Cat6 and Cat7 cables to install in your homes or office setups, then this article will be of great help. In this article, we are going to compare these two and also illuminate the main differences between them so that it may become easy for you to choose the one.


  Besides, when talking about Cat6 and Cat7 cables, the main [difference](https://www.electronics-notes.com/articles/connectivity/ethernet-ieee-802-3/cables-types-pinout-cat-5-5e-6.php) between both of them is between the frequency and speed. As far as the speed is concerned, Cat6 cables are found to be containing a maximum length of 100m providing a maximum speed of almost 1.000Mbit/s, and Cat7 also comes in a maximum of 100m length but provides the speed of almost 10.000Mbit/s. However, the standard frequency provided by Cat6 cables is almost 250MHz and by Cat7 is about 600MHz. So it is obvious that Cat7 has greater speed and frequency than Cat6 and is better in both signal and data transferring speed as compared to it.

  ### \#1. Price Difference


  When compared at a price, Cat7 cables are more expensive than cat6 cables due to some additional high-quality features. The higher the category, the higher is the price. 


  If you are planning to set up the Ethernet connection at home, make sure you choose the best quality and high category Ethernet cable that lives there working for a longer period. For this, do not think much about a few pound difference in price. But if you think your budget is low, then we suggest you move towards buying some lower category cables as these are good too in their performance. 


  ### \#2. Durability


  In the case of durability, as Cat7 is more expensive than cat6 Ethernet cable, so is also made more durable and long-living. Although Cat6 cables are also durable enough to support your connection needs up to an extended period but, cat7 cables comparatively have greater life to meet all the requirements set by your for a network provider. 


  This long life and durability can be of much help when you want a reliable internet connection provider at home to do whatever you want to in a relatively lesser time. You don’t have to speed additional money each time on buying and setting up a completely new cable within some time so that you can have a speedy internet connection. 


  ### \#3. Connectors 


  This is where these Ethernet cables are similar. Whenever you finalize to install the cable at home, whether Cat6 or Cat7, you don’t have to worry about the type of connectors that you would need for the better installation of both. The reason for this is that both the cables use the same types of connectors. However, the use of the type of connectors strictly depends upon the installation. 


  Most of the time, RJ45 or the keystone jack is used, but as Ca6 comes in both shielded and non-shielded versions, you would have to match up the connectors with the shielding types. And, on the other hand, Cat7 cables come only in shielded versions, which are capable of providing the higher frequencies, so it needs a complete shielded network. So, to get optimal performance from the cable, you need to shield the RJ45, keystone jack, and also the patch panels. 


  By doing this, you can get the premium performance from your cables, and this premium performance will definitely affect the quality of your internet usage in a very positive way. 


  ## Which one is good for gaming?


  Both Cat6 and Cat7 cables are considered [good for gaming](https://trustedperks.com/best-ethernet-cables-for-gaming/). Each of them has its own specific features that are great in increasing the chances of getting a better online gaming experience. 


  Cat6 cables are popular for better handling the interference issues and are better protected against crosstalk and external noise that may affect your focus in the game. These interferences, crosstalk, and noises can make you nil in detecting precisely the movements of your opponents in-game. They can also hinder your effective detection of the blast, fire, or shooting that may help you in deciding for your next move. So, these cables can prove to be the best choice for you when you are thinking to install them as a perfect solution to all your internet related problems that hinder your effective performance in games. 


  Cat6 cable does this because of the presence of “spline,” which is a separator that is present within the cable and is responsible for dividing the individual copper wires within these twisted pairs. This separation reduces crosstalk between the cables up to much extent and thus improves the signal quality to a significant extent. Thus, these cables make the signals more stable and accurate in reaching up to you, which proves to be a great edge for you in your gaming. Also, cat6 cable can operate better at up to almost 100m with this extra shielding.

These are great options if you want zero packet losses and deterioration in signal strength, which is actually wanted to boost up your gaming experience. These cables come with shielded connectors, which are great in effective reduction of EMI/RFI interference that provides the optimal signal transfer without any issue of loss of strength. This can be helpful for you if you do not want your gaming to be interrupted mid-way and be left behind in any gaming round. 


  Besides, when you plan to install Cat7 Ethernet cable for gaming, keep in mind that there is one difficulty that you are going to face, and that is, these cables don’t use the kind of header connections that you can find easily on most gaming PCs and consoles. So, these cables do not easily get fit into every gaming device that you have. 


  ## A quick and short comparison between Cat 6 and Cat 7 cables 


  Both Cat 6 and Cat 7 Ethernet cables are highly efficient in taking care of all your internet related needs. Whether you are planning to install them as a solution to your gaming problems or data transfer issues, both of them come with some great features to help. 


  Despite the fact both these cables greatly differ in terms of frequency, speed, manufacturing, price, and durability, there are still a lot of features that make them similar, like their forms, usage, connector types, and distance. 


  Although both of them are premium grade cables that are perfect for reducing packet loss, latency, signals loss, and interference, these differences make them well enough to fit in as a solution for one issue or the other. This effective elimination of all the network-related issues makes these cables a premium choice for any gamer as well as an office worker who needs super fast speed for data transfer. 


  ### Connecting The Dots


  None of the cables is worst in any scenario, but still, the choice of the cable depends upon personal preference. If you have a good amount to spend in solving your networking issues, we suggest you go for cat 7 cable as it is a bit high priced than Cat 6 cable. The plus point of buying the Cat 7 cable is it is more durable than cat 6 and lives a longer life to meet the requirements. 


  While turning the picture, when you think of buying Cat 7 cable, it also has a flaw that it comes with specialized header connections that do not easily fit into any gaming console or PC. These specialized connectors can make an issue for you as they might be a perfect match for the gaming device that you use.
