  ### **Buyer's Guide - How to find the best Ethernet Cables**


  Now that you have gone through our extensive reviews for products of the Best Ethernet Cables for Gaming in terms of their features and drawbacks, you might feel like you are far better equipped to make a decision. However just because you may feel like you know which device is right for you, doesn’t mean that’s accurate. That’s why it is still recommended to go over this detailed buying guide as well to properly understand the technicalities of these devices.


  This buyer’s guide will be helpful for first-time users that have no experience since it can be daunting to buy the best Ethernet cables for gaming for yourself. To start, we are going to look at the main questions that you should always ask before you buy an Ethernet cable, and then we will answer a few of the most frequently asked questions.


  ##### **What is your current network speed?**


  The first question you should ask yourself is of course what the speed and status of your current home internet connection. If it falls in the category of gigabit internet which is 1Gbps, you may get an older Ethernet cable model. Alternatively, if your connection is slower than that, then you can invest in any category 5 or above with ease.


  Checkout this guide by [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/how-to/heres-how-to-get-lower-ping-for-online-gaming/) on How to decrease ping in online gaming. With higher ping its difficult to compete in online gaming.


  The best thing about advancements in technology is that routers are becoming better and better and this makes them able to be compatible with and complement network speeds that are faster than ever. This is one reason why, whenever you seek to change your Ethernet connection, it is advisable to get a recent version or updated model because the networks can handle them. This includes but is not restricted to Cat 6a or a Cat 8 cable. 


  ##### **What is the length of the cable?**


  The next most important question is about the length of the cable or the LAN. This is because it is directly proportional to the quality of the signals that you will get. While it is not constant, it is true that in most cases, the more the length of the cable, the less the quality of the signal. This is why you might experience worse network performance and slower transfer rates as well.


  This is why if you want the fastest speeds and performance, you should invest in a cable that is as short as possible and comes with a connector already attached. This can be done by manually measuring the distance between the router and your gaming station. For any Ethernet cable, the optimal length that you should be investing in should not exceed 100 meters.


  ##### **What is the capacity of the Wireless Access Point?**


  Next, always consider what your access point is. This is important because you need to make sure you are aware of the limitations and benefits of your [wireless access point](https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-gaming-routers) before you buy a cable. This is where the point about capacity comes in. this will be super important because you need to make sure the device is following the minimum requirements.


  ##### **Is it compatible with your equipment?**


  Our final question has to do with compatibility and this is especially important for gamers because most internet cables that they use will be of the same brand as their equipment provider. The most common of all of these is the OEM brand and the reason for their popularity is that these cables are meant to be compatible with almost all gaming consoles. To make sure you get the right cable, simply check what ports and jacks the gaming console you own are good

faq:
  - ques: What Ethernet cable is best for gaming?
    ans: >
      This is a question that will be best answered when you know what your
      requirements and the limitations of your gaming system are. The most
      commonly used ones are both Cat5e and Cat6 as these are the popular
      choices when it comes to gaming over Ethernet connections. 


      Out of these two, Cat6 cables are the winner but you will be surprised why that is. This advantage doesn’t only have to do with the speed this cable provides, but it is alsobecause Cat6 cables have been engineered to handle interference better than other models. 
  - ques: " Is a shorter Ethernet cable faster?"
    ans: >
      As we have discussed before, yes there is truth to the idea thata shorter
      Ethernet cable will be faster? However, there are other more important
      factors to consider such as placement. The cable has to be attached in a
      way that ensures it is going to your console or PC from the upside. 


      This is because the bytes work best when gravity is on their side and this allows them to travel faster. However, alternatively, if it is faster upload rates you are looking for, then the cable should ideally come from the downside up. 


      In terms of the question about length, you shouldn’t be too worried because the actual effect that this has on your transmission speed will be quite minimal. This means that for every 100 feet of cable, you will only get 100 ns of delay, so that’s not a lot. 
  - ques: " What is the fastest Ethernet cable?"
    ans: Of course, the latest category which is Cat 8,is the fastest because it is
      also the next generation of Ethernet cables. However, since it is not
      widely available, this means that the previous Cat 7a still its rightful
      spot as the fastest performing Ethernet cord available right now. The
      Cat7a along with the Cat 6a and Cat 7 models all can support speeds up to
      10,000 Mbps.
  - ques: Does longer Ethernet cable slow down the internet?
    ans: Hypothetically, sure.Practically? Not really. All of the cords on our list
      are 100 feet or less, and while our longest model may see a little bit of
      slowdown when compared to a five-foot alternative, it’s largely going to
      be negligible. Once you start looking at 300-foot cords, you may start to
      perceive noticeable effects, but you should be perfectly fine in the range
      of models that we’ve highlighted on our list.
  - ques: " Are expensive Ethernet cables worth it?"
    ans: >
      Since cheaper Cat6 cables can be bought at lower prices, these are usually
      the ones uninformed buyers will opt for.  This means that you will be
      getting the cheaper and also less quality cable just because it is
      affordable. This is a rookie mistake that only inexperienced installers
      will suggest.


      The worst part is that these crooks will even charge you more even though they are installing the much cheaper option just to make a profit. Unsuspecting users will be scammed and in the long run, will be at a disadvantage. You will only catch up to their scheme when you finally try to run your data and network only to realize that the speeds are much slower. 


      Another reason to stay away from cheaper cables is that these have not been manufactured with the same fire safety codes and this is a health risk.  Another issue that arises is that the longer cable runs end up being non-functional. You will end up having to install new cables all over again as there is no other fix. You may even get more damage if the cheaper cables catch on fire.
