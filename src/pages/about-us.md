We started Trusted Perks in 2017. The story behind this website is a little different. Ryan was searching for a Mousepad for his newly bought gaming setup. That's when He realized that more than 70% websites lie about the products that they mentioned. They all write Biased reviews and none of them actually works. That's when Ryan decided that he will start his own Blog where there will be no Biasness.
